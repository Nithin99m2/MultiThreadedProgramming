# Concurrency_Parallelism_and_Networking

Three problems are demonstrated here to learn basics of multi-threaded programming,synchronizing multiple threads using locks,condition variables and semaphores and basic networking concepts.


## Client_Server
MultiThreaded Client and Server is a simulation of the Real world scenario where multiple clients are making requests to a single server.In this program,inorder to give the impression of multiple users from different parts of the world, sending commands to the same server,each client is simulated using a thread which will try to connect with the server independent of each other.The number of client requests throughout the course of the simulation are specified at the start of input.The request is processed at the server side and the corresponding output is sent back to the client.


## Course_Allocation
Course Allocation Portal is a simulation of Real World application where a student can take trial classes of a course and can withdraw and opt for a different course if he/she does not like the course. Different labs in the college have been asked to provide students who can act as course TA mentors temporarily and take the trial tutorials.


## Football_Stadium
The Clasico Experience is a simulation of a Real World football match at a stadium.The two teams involved for any match are home team and away team.This program concentrates on the simulation of people coming to the stadium to watch the match, buy tickets to a particular zone, watch the match and then exit.
